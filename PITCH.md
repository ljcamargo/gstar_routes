# PITCH: G*Routes

## The Problem
Mexico City's public transport system is one of the most complex in the world, with over 12 Metro lines, 7 Metrobús lines, Cablebús, Trolebús, and more. While traditional algorithms can find the shortest path, they often miss the "human" element—considering transfer difficulty, security, and real-world reasoning that experienced commuters use.

## The Solution
** G*Routes ** redefines transit routing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. By passing a pre-filtered graph of station edges to Gemini, we move beyond simple mathematics. We allow the AI to "think" through the route, offering paths that aren't just shorter, but *better*.

## Aims & Objectives
1. **MVP Demonstration**: Port a robust Kotlin-based LLM routing implementation to a modern web stack.
2. **AI Reasoning**: Validate that Gemini can effectively solve graph search problems when provided with context-rich subsets of data.
3. **User Experience**: Provide a "wow" factor with a premium, high-tech interface that feels as advanced as the underlying tech.
4. **Future Growth**: Lay the foundation for a "Public Transport Copilot" that can handle real-time disruptions and multi-modal travel through natural language.

## Why it Matters
We are moving away from rigid, rule-based systems toward adaptive, reasoning systems. G*Routes is a pioneer in applying generative AI to the fundamental problem of urban mobility in one of the world's largest megalopolises.
